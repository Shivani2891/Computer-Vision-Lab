# Computer-Vision-Lab
I performed this lab in google colab , so I did not have to install any library.So, no special requirements.
For computer vision lab,task 1, dataset emergency vehicle vs non emergency vehicle is required which is in the zipped folder I uploaded  in the canvas.
For the other tasks, no external dataset is used.
